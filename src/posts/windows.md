This blog post will guide you on how to get Windows Pro for free on Windows 10 and Windows 11.
I have personally used this program myself, and I have found myself using it so much, that I've decided to write a post on it.

You can use this guide for anything, such as RDP (Remote Desktop Protocol), which is a Windows Pro feature.

# Installing Windows Pro for free
1. Open **Powershell** on your PC.
2. Paste in `irm https://massgrave.dev/get | iex` into the console, and press enter.
3. Disable your connection to the internet, or else it will not work.
4. Press **7** on your keyboard to go into the Extras menu.
5. Now, press **1** to go to the Windows Edition menu.
6. Choose "Professional Edition" from the list of editions.
7. Choose the first method, it's recommended.
8. Wait a few minutes until your PC fully restarts.
9. Enable your connection to the internet, and connect to your internet.
10.  Repeat step **1** and **2** again.
11.  This time, press **1** on your keyboard to activate Windows Pro with HWID.
12.  That's it! *You might need to restart your PC after this to fully activate it.*

You're welcome, use this for anything you want to.
And don't worry, it isn't illegal.
